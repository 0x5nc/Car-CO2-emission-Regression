When more than one independent variable is present, the process is called multiple linear regression. An example of multiple linear regression is predicting co2emission using the features FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB, EngineSize and Cylinders of cars. The good thing here is that multiple linear regression model is the extension of the simple linear regression model.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"button":false,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Coefficients:  [[10.29246043  8.5294023   9.26187753]]\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn import linear_model\n","regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()\n","x = np.asanyarray(train[['ENGINESIZE','CYLINDERS','FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB']])\n","y = np.asanyarray(train[['CO2EMISSIONS']])\n","regr.fit (x, y)\n","# The coefficients\n","print ('Coefficients: ', regr.coef_)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["As mentioned before, **Coefficient** and **Intercept**  are the parameters of the fitted line.\n","Given that it is a multiple linear regression model with 3 parameters and that the parameters are the intercept and coefficients of the hyperplane, sklearn can estimate them from our data.
